Let:

Let does not create windows object unlike var..(i.e "this." can not be used with Let varialbes)
Let is block scope. Can not be redeclared in same scope but can be done in different scopes. can make use of blocks to redeclare the let variable.
A ReferenceError is occured when we try to use the let varialbe without initializing it.



Const:

Const creates a variable with constant values and should be declared and defined in the same statement.
Const is also block scope just like let.
Can not be reinitilized. In case of const objects, the value can be changes but keys cannot be.
In case of const arrays, the value of arrays can be updated but the array can not be dirrectly assigned to a value.
Can not be redeclared in the same scope.
